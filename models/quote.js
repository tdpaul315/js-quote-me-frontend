//Think OOJS - how do you create objects (initialization, classes, instances....SOUNDS LIKE RUBBBBBY)

class Quote{
    constructor(id, text, author, year, likes) {
        this.id = id;
        this.text = text; 
        this.author = author; 
        this.year = year; 
        this.likes = likes; 
    }
}

//^^^^^^^^ CONSTRUCTOR METHOD INITIALIZES AND CREATES NEW INSTANCES OF THE QUOTE OBJECT ^^^^^^^^ 
// Now I need a way to see the object I created (when the user hits submit, the new quote should append to the page) -- Do I do that in this file?
