Welcome to the Don't Quote Me App where you can keep track of all of the clever things you like to say!

INTRODUCTION: The Don't Quote Me App's sole purpose is to provide a resource to people who are passionate about saying cool things and making them quotable. The site is still in development so any pull requests are welcome!

APP BACKGROUND: To solve the issue of not having any way to keep up with all of those clever things we say during the day but don't want to write down, this app was created to 

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: Built using Rails v6.0.3.4 on the backend and Vanilla JS on the frontend in Visual Studio Code

PREREQUISITES:

Fork and clone this repository and the backend repo from GitHub. Link to backend [here](https://github.com/tdpaul315/js-quote-me-backend)

Run rails s or rails server in the command line for the backend repo. This will start the server locally so the application data can be accessible. 

On the frontend type npx reload-b to run the node server and it will automatically navigate to localhost:8080.  

INSTRUCTIONS:

Once the server is running and you have navigated to the application, you will be greeted with the main page. This is a single page app that includes a quote form and options to listen and delete a quote once its been created. 

*Adding a comment and liking a quote will be added once user authentication has been integrated*
